# SOC-Analyst-1---TryHackMe-Labs

## Objective

The SOC Analyst 1 Path on TryHackMe.com focuses on the practical skills a Junior Security Analyst would need to solve the daily challenges in a SOC environment. This path focuses on 8 sections of cybersecurity, and includes a variety of practical applications and labs to utilize my abilities as a SOC Analyst. In these CTF labs, my task was to perform analysis on monitoring/investigating alerts, configure security tools, develop IDS signatures, and exfiltrate to Tier 2 Team leads for further investigation. After completing these sections, I was able to increase my experience as a Triage & Cybersecurity Specialist.

# Cyber Defense Frameworks

- Understand the tasks and responsibilities of a SOC Analyst 1 by utilizing the modern-day frameworks used by experts.
- Pyramid of Pain lab emphasized the levels of difficulties an attacker would normally encounter each time a Blue Team defense team would successfully defend their attacks.
- Cyber Kill Chain highlighted the stages of each phase of an attack. By using this framework I was able to understand the flow of a real-life attack, with the goal of preventing the attacker to reach the Action on Objectives phase.
- Diamond Model established the relationship between the adversary, infrastructure, victim, and their capability.
- By understanding the MITRE ATT&CK framework, I can quickly dive into the techniques used by adversaries as well as provide the correct mitigations for that specific tactic.<br>
- The Summit Lab dove into the Pyramid of Pain with 5 CTFs. In this lab, my task was to defend alerts by a red team attempting to penetrate the endpoints. By using the data in the alerts I was able to establish hash, IP, and DNS rules against malicious sites. Then I had to analyze a network log to dissect the source of malicious traffic from an IP address, while also creating a Sigma Rule for the appropriate host/network Artifacts found in the systems. Finally I created a process creation rule to prevent a malicious executable from exfiltrating data in the system.
